Lego Swipe
Overview
Lego Swipe is a unique project that combines the excitement of Lego building with the popular swiping format. It's a Tinder-like experience where users can explore and discover random Lego creations, swiping right for builds they love and left for those that don't quite click. The goal is to provide a fun and spontaneous way for Lego enthusiasts to find inspiration, discover new building styles, and perhaps stumble upon their next creative masterpiece.

Features
1. Random Lego Swiping
Experience the thrill of randomly generated Lego builds. Swipe right to express your admiration or swipe left to pass on to the next creation. It's a simple and enjoyable way to explore the endless possibilities of Lego building.
